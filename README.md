Map the (E)ER diagram into the Oracle OR data model.

Q1. Find the street name where maximum number of students lives. Display the street name and number of students who live on that street.
Q2. Find the youngest students who live on the same street. Display the ssn, student name, age for each street name.
Q3. In one query, display the maximum, minimum, and average age of the PhD students who are assigned to at least 2 tasks.
Q4. Find the percentage of PhD students among all PhD students who drives bicycle and assigned to video shooting task. Number of PhD students = PhD+Both in status field of student table in the dataset.
Q5. Find the percentage of (only) master’s students among all students who drive sports cars and assigned to picture shooting task. Number of Masters students = Master in status field of student table in the dataset.
Q6. Find the largest surface-area building which owns at least 3 stations. List all the paths which include alt least one station of this building. (Answer include Building_Code, Surface_Area, Path_Name, Station)
Q7. Display the number of hops for each task and order your result by number of hops in descending order (ie: task-1 starts at “s6” and ends in “s1”; along the path between start and end there is “s7” so the total number of hops
needed to be visited is 3 for task-1)
Q8. Display the number of hops and student ssn for each student in order to complete all the assigned tasks. Order your results by ascending hop number. (ie: total number of hops that 111-11-3333 will visit is 2 in order to
complete all the tasks assigned to him)
Q9. Find the student ssn, address, name who has to cover maximum distance (in terms of the number of station hopes) in order to complete all the assigned tasks. List the number of hops and the license plate of his vehicle
too.
